# bannerflowTestApp
Backend code test

In this application, implemented a simple logic for access and editing of banners (CRUD) with tests. As the database it uses MongoDB. To configure the connection string, it's needed to change a 'appsettings.json' file with suitable settings(both, for web and test projects). 
Each test session will create a new database with a random name.
